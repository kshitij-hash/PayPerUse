# FlowForge: The Universal API Adapter for the Paid Web 

FlowForge is a powerful backend solution designed to bridge the gap between your application and the growing ecosystem of paid APIs. It provides a seamless way to integrate services that require per-call micropayments, handling all the complexities of cryptocurrency transactions, wallet management, and multi-step workflows so you can focus on building great products.

## The Problem

The internet is moving towards a model of direct value exchange, where users can pay for the exact resources they consume. This is powered by a new generation of APIs that require small, per-use payments. However, integrating with these services is a significant challenge for developers. It involves:

- **Complex Crypto Payments:** Handling private keys, signing transactions, and interacting with blockchain networks.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Chaining multiple paid API calls together to create sophisticated applications.
- **Wallet Management:** Securely creating and managing cryptocurrency wallets for the application or its users.

## The Solution: FlowForge

FlowForge is the middleware that makes the paid web accessible. It acts as a universal adapter, simplifying interactions with paid services and enabling developers to build next-generation applications with ease.

### Key Features

- **Effortless Micropayments:** Call any x402-enabled API with a simple, standard HTTP request. FlowForge takes care of the cryptographic signing and payment process in the background.
- **Powerful Agent Orchestration:** Define complex, multi-step workflows (we call them "agents") that combine different services. FlowForge executes these agents seamlessly, managing payments for each step automatically.
- **Simplified Wallet Integration:** Easily create and manage Coinbase CDP wallets through a simple API, abstracting away the low-level blockchain interactions.
- **Centralized Service Registry:** Discover and utilize a growing registry of paid services, from AI and data processing to decentralized infrastructure, all through a unified interface.

## Who is it for?

FlowForge is built for developers and businesses who want to:

- Leverage cutting-edge AI and other paid APIs without the headache of crypto integration.
- Build applications that monetize through per-use API access.
- Create sophisticated workflows that combine multiple paid services into a single, powerful function.
